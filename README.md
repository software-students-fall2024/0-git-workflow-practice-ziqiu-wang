<p style="text-align:center;">
The article I found is https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html. 

This [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html) was written by a female software engineering, who experienced workplace harassment at Google while she worked there. She really enjoyed the working environment until a male supervisor began to say inappropriate words to her. She was reluctant at first to speak up because she feared that no other jobs would be better than her job at Google, but she finally spoke up and reported the harassment. However, it took a very long time for Google to investigate the incident and finally corroborate the author's claims. Although Google claimed that the harasser received severe punishment, nothing seemed to really happen to him. Because the author took a paid leave during the investigation process to avoid meeting the harasser every day, she was declined when she broached the subject of promotion as she was considered too fragile. The author finally left Google and decided to "not love a job anymore". I find this article interesting because it reveals some of the dark sides of the so-called renowned tech companies, as well as the risks and challenges faced by female software engineers. 

Annabella Lee pl2220: This story tells the complexities of working in a huge tech companies like Google. From a software engineering perspective, the text talks about many workplace cultures, especially in high-pressure, fast-paced tech environments. While software engineers may seek innovation in top-tier companies, this story reminds us that no job, no matter how good it seems,  it should compromise one's dignity. It also points to the need for more open, supportive cultures in tech that foster not just innovation, but also respect and safety.
